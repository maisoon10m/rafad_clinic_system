3. Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive web-based clinic appointment management system called "Rafad-رَفَد" that streamlines clinic operations by providing administrators with extensive oversight tools, assisting doctors effectively manage their schedules, and facilitating patient appointment booking. This solution will increase overall clinic productivity, eliminating the need for phone-based appointment scheduling, and reduce administrative workload by providing a user-friendly digital platform accessible via web browsers. ________________________________________


4. Objectives
1.	To develop a cross-platform web application for clinic appointment management accessible via standard web browsers.
2.	To implement secure user authentication and role-based access control for three user types: patients, doctors, and administrators.
3.	To create an intuitive appointment booking system that allows patients to schedule, view, and cancel appointments online.
4.	To provide doctors with real-time schedule management tools for viewing appointments and managing availability.
5.	To build a comprehensive administrative dashboard for managing doctors, viewing all appointments, and generating basic reports.
